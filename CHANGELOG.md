# Changelog

All notable changes to MeClaw are documented in this file. One entry per released
package. The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versioning follows SemVer (0.x: minor/patch bumps for additive features).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Message browser** — the colony's message log is now browsable:
  - `GET /colony/messages`: read-only list endpoint over `message_log` with keyset
    pagination, filters (`to_path` incl. prefix, `from_path`, `trace_id`,
    `correlation_id`, `body_kind`, time range), a two-stage query (indexed predicates
    first, residual filters under an explicit `scan_budget`, default 5000 / hard cap
    50000) and optional on-demand blob resolution (`?resolve_blob=true`).
  - `/ui/messages`: list view with filter form, keyset paging and truncated payload
    preview. Truncated scans are always disclosed in the UI.
  - `/ui/message`: envelope detail view with `context` and `hop` headers rendered
    separately, pretty-printed payload, lazy blob loading, and pivot navigation
    (trace view, parent-message chain, correlation, reply-to, dead letters).
  - Dead-letter view: new "Original" column linking to the originating message where
    it exists in the message log.

### Notes

- Messages that fail before the log write exist only as dead letters; the dead-letter
  entry itself carries the full message. Tracked as a documented deferral.
- The new endpoint is read-only and not EDA-dispatchable (like `/colony/dead_letters`).
